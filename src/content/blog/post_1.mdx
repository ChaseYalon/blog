# Preface
I wrote this on the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, at that point the now complete then imminent dismantling of USAID (United States Agency for International Development). USAID then and up until its death did great work helping the people of Vietnam, helping to clean up the mess we made with all of our napalm.

50 years  
50 years since the tanks burst through the gate   
50 years since the helicopter lifted from the roof  
50 years since Ford played golf and walls fell  

Walls of the embassy, stormed by refugees  
Walls of soldiers, turned to same  
Walls that have divided a country for a generation, gone  
In an instant  

In the night, cold and silent  
A barge, singular flying just one flag, from an American consulate  
300 men women and children, drifting silently through the night  
The heroism of those USAID officers, saving 300 innocent lives  

50 years gone by  
A war started in Tonkin  
Ending in Saigon  
This should be happy, serene butâ€¦ 

And those same consulates  
Those USAID HQ's  
That once shown bright as beacons of freedom in a dark desolate world  
Now just empty hulls, waiting to return to the earth.
