As I am writing this back to school is just 2-3 weeks until back to school for millions of kids across the country. Also as I am writing the Department of Education is seemingly [breathing its last breath](https://apnews.com/article/trump-education-department-scotus-layoffs-student-loans-f24637f2a1d57432f6dc24d082e95b9b). This court ([or its billionaire donors](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-other-billionaires-sokol-huizenga-novelly-supreme-court)) has seen fit to enable President Trump and his education secretary Linda McMahon to dismantle the Department, created may I add by an [act of congress](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-726/pdf/COMPS-726.pdf), and funded by [another act of congress](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/). It is unclear what is happening to its 44 billion dollars, its about 4200 employees (as of Jan 20, 2025). My school reive about [2.6 million dollars](https://www.usnews.com/education/k12/new-jersey/districts/moorestown-township-public-school-district-103727#:~:text=Finances%20at%20Moorestown%20Township%20Public,%24274.4%20million%20on%20other%20expenses.). Thankfully that is only 2.6% of my schools budget but many many schools will be hurt much more. This could hurt people who use free lunch ([unless of course there is a trans kid, then their fucked anyways](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-administration-settles-maine-funding-freeze-dispute-trans-athlet-rcna204541)). It is also to note then while the administration talks a big talk about replacing the money (somehow), their proposed budget reduces funding by 15%, as well as [firing huge portions of its staff](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-education-department-firings.html). The point of this poorly worded rant is to say this, millions of Americans will return to school between now and labor day. All of them deserve a first class education that can prepare them for the real world. The problem is, those cost money and the government should be working as hard as possible to foot the bill, not gutting a key department. And that is saying nothing about the student loans, the disability accommodation enforcement or any of the hundreds of other DoE programs that will be gutted. Write to your congressmen and tell them that you want a well funded and strong Department of Education.
